What are the significant software concepts that this combination of technologies has that each previous set of technologies did not? Or that they handle significantly differently?

Meteor was able to launch the app really fast and leverages Svelte which was used previous in the Node example. However, Meteor was able to take care of both MongoDB and Node in the backend by calling libraries and sending all the data in addition to HTML to the frontend which was really impressive. Meteor is also capable of being used for all devices from desktop to mobile.
