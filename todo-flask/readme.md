What are the significant software concepts that this combination of technologies has that each previous set of technologies did not? Or that they handle significantly differently?

Flask was an extremely lightweight framework that I've used in the past. It is a python library that doesn't require the use of an external database hosting site (for development purposes) unlike Firebase and MongoDB. However, this means that your data cannot persist unless connected to a third party database hosting site. This combination of technology also had the concept of routes which changed the url, but still allowed for GET and POST commands. The routes were different from any other technology, but it allowed for easy use and makes clear what are the different functions and pages in the app, from the point of view of a developer.
