What are the significant software concepts that this combination of technologies has that each previous set of technologies did not? Or that they handle significantly differently?
The most significant software concept that Firebase had over MongoDB Atlas was its amazing documentation that enabled quick copy and paste for developers to build quickly. Firebase is the second database source that we have used so far -- flutter and javascript both leaned on the frontend todo list functionality, which did not allow for data to be accessed from a different server, whereas the Firebase database persists across sessions and devices by accessing the database. Svelte was extremely well utilized by its create-react-app like template starter, which I really liked and was not found in javascript or node (Flutter also had this technology). Lastly, Svelte allows for all JS, HTML, and CSS code to be put into the same file which is extremely unique and makes it easy to have all your code in one file.
